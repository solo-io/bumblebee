BumbleBee helps to build, run and distribute eBPF programs using OCI images. It allows you to focus on writing eBPF code, while taking care of the user space components - automatically exposing your data as metrics or logs.

## Getting Started

The first step to get started is to install `bee` using one of the [installation](#Installation) techniques listed below.

Once `bee` has been installed we can go ahead and initialize our first `eBPF` probe! To do this you just need to run one command! (no seriously that's it.)
*Note*: This will only work on linux. If you don't have access to a linux machine, [Vagrant](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vagrant/getting-started-install) will work as well!

```bash
sudo bee run ghcr.io/solo-io/bumblebee/tcpconnect:$(bee version)
```
To see data populated simply run `curl httpbin.org` in another window.

*Note*: If you installed `bee` via the install script you may see an issue with the `bee` command not being available when run with `sudo`.
See the [note on permissions](#a-note-on-permissions) for more info, but to quickly get started you can use the following command as an alternative:

```bash
sudo env "PATH=$PATH" bee run ghcr.io/solo-io/bumblebee/tcpconnect:$(bee version)
```

Now that you have run your first example program, you can go ahead and write your own with our [tutorial](docs/getting_started.md).

## Installation

### Using our install script

Download the latest version:

```bash
curl -sL https://run.solo.io/bee/install | sh
```

Or download a given version (e.g. v0.0.8):

```bash
curl -sL https://run.solo.io/bee/install | BUMBLEBEE_VERSION=v0.0.8 sh
```

### Using go
```bash
git clone git@github.com:solo-io/bumblebee.git
cd bumblebee
# install to GOBIN (defaults to ~/go/bin/), can be used as `bee` if GOBIN is on your PATH
go install ./bee
```

#### Other options

You can also navigate to the releases page [here](https://github.com/solo-io/bumblebee/releases/) for more versions/information.

### A note on permissions

Loading eBPF programs to the kernel (`bee run` command) requires elevated privileges. 
You can either run `bee` as root (with sudo), or add capabilities to the binary.
Adding capabilities is the preferred method, as if you run `bee run` with `sudo`, it will not find local images when you run `bee build` without sudo.

To add capabilities, run the following command:

```bash
sudo setcap cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_admin+eip $(which bee)
```

On newer kernels you may be able to pare down the capabilities added, for example a recent addition is the `CAP_BPF` capability.

### Uninstall

If you installed `bee` via the install script, you can uninstall `bee` by removing the directory:

```bash
rm -rf $HOME/.bumblebee/
```

If you used `bee` as root or via sudo, remove the following directory:

```bash
rm -rf /root/.bumblebee
```

### Thanks

This project would not be possible without the valuable open-source work of projects in the eBPF community. Specifically, we would like to thank the [eBPF go](https://github.com/cilium/ebpf/) library and [libbpf-tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/libbpf-tools/).
