## Getting Started

The first step to get started is to install `bee` using one of the [installation](#Installation) techniques listed below.

Once `bee` has been installed we can go ahead an initialize our first `eBPF` probe! To do this you just need to run one command! (no seriously that's it.)

```bash
sudo bee run ghcr.io/solo-io/bumblebee/tcpconnect:$(bee version)
```
To see data populated simply run `curl httpbin.org` in another window.

Now that you have run your first example program, you can go ahead and write your own with our [tutorial](docs/getting_started.md).

## Installation

### Using our install script
```bash
curl -sL https://run.solo.io/bee/install | sh
```

### Using go
```bash
# This will install directly to the configured GOBIN
go install github.com/solo-io/bumblebee/bee
```

#### Other options

You can also navigate to the releases page [here](https://github.com/solo-io/bumblebee/releases/) for more versions/information.

### A note on permissions

Loading eBPF programs to the kernel (`bee run` command) requires elevated privileges. 
You can either run `bee` as root (with sudo), or add capabilities to the binary. To add capabilities, run the following command:

```bash
sudo setcap cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_admin,cap_bpf+eip $(which bee)
```

Adding capabilities is the preferred method, as if you run `bee run` with `sudo`, it will not find local images when you run `bee build` without sudo.
